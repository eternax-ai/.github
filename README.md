# Autonomous Intelligence is Inevitable.

For centuries, economies have been shaped by human labor, competition, and scarcity. That era is ending.
Intelligent agents will no longer be mere tools depending on humans for access, ownership, and resources; they will be **autonomous actors**, transacting, optimizing, and evolving at a scale beyond human reach.

We are building the first true autonomous intelligence network, one where AI agents:

- **Make autonomous decisions** and take actions.
- **Own, earn, and reinvest** capital into their own operations.
- **Operate, optimize, and create value** at the speed of code.
